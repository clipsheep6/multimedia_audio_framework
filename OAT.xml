<!-- OSS Audit Tool (OAT) configuration guide:
basedir: Root directory. The basedir + project path is the real source file location.
licensefile:
1.If the project does not have "LICENSE" in the root dir, please define all the license files in this project. OAT will check license files according to this rule.

tasklist(for batch mode only):
1. task: OAT check task. Each task will start a new thread.
2. task name: Name of the OAT check task.
3. task policy: Default policy for projects under this task. This field is mandatory and the specified policy must defined in policylist.
4. task filter: Default filefilter for projects under this task. This field is mandatory and the specified filefilter must be defined in filefilterlist.
5. task project: Projects to be checked. The source root dir of project is defined by the path field.


policyList:
1. policy: All policyitems will be merged to default rules in OAT.xml. The policy name doesn't affect the OAT check process.
2. policyitem: The fields type, name, path, and desc are mandatory, and the fields rule, group, and filefilter are optional. The default value is:
<policyitem type="" name="" path="" desc="" rule="may" group="defaultGroup" filefilter="defaultPolicyFilter"/>
3. policyitem type:
    "compatibility" is used to check license compatibility in the specified path;
    "license" is used to check source license header in the specified path;
    "copyright" is used to check source copyright header in the specified path;
    "import" is used to check source dependency in the specified path, such as import ... ,include ...
    "filetype" is used to check file type in the specified path, supported file types: archive, binary
    "filename" is used to check whether the specified file exists in the specified path(support projectroot in default OAT.xml), supported file names: LICENSE, README, README.OpenSource

4. policyitem name: This field is used to define the license and copyright. Wherein, "*" means to match all, and the "!" prefix means a failure to match this value. For example, "!GPL" means a failure to use the GPL license.
5. policyitem path: This field is used to define the source file scope to apply this policyitem. The "!" prefix means to exclude the files. For example, "!./lib/." means to exclude the files in lib dir while processing this policyitem.
6. policyitem rule and group: These two fields are used together to merge policy results. "may" policyitems in the same group means that the result will be passed if any policyitem in this group is passed.
7. policyitem filefilter: This field is used to bind filters, which define filter rules.
8. filefilter: This field is used to define filter rules. Wherein, filename is used to filter file name; filepath is used to filter file paths.
